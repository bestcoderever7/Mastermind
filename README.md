Mastermind
==========
In this classic memory game, a random color combination is selected by the program. You have to click one of the color
choices for each slot. Then, in a JOptionPane, the program will tell which ones you got correct and which ones you
got incorrect, with a "C" for correct and an "I" for incorrect. When you get all four right,the program will generate
another combination and you will start over. If you make a mistake, there is also an "undo" button. Get 1000 points
and you unlock hard mode. Get another 1000 points and you unlock very hard mode. Finally, get another 1000 points and
you unlock impossible mode. If you can somehow manage to get 1000 points in impossible mode, you are a Mastermind!
Your prize is another set of colors to play the game with. Bobo the Elephant says, "Enjoy!"
